\subsection{Sampling Efficiency and UQ}

\begin{itemize}
    \item (\checkmark) Theoretical distribution of the order statistics and sample quantiles.
    \item ($\cdot$) Propagating uncertainty in sample quantiles through the CDF reconstruction and sampling steps.
    \item ($\cdot$) Propagating uncertainty through time.  Monte-Carlo approach.
    \item (\checkmark-) Effect of increasing the number of resampling points.  Increases mixing and reduces variance.
    \item (\checkmark-) Importance sampling.
\end{itemize}
