\section{Machine Learning Model Trained on CFD Data Source}

\begin{itemize}
    \item (\checkmark-) Harvesting CFD data for training. Explain the pre-processing pipeline.
    \item ($\cdot$) Why use gradient boosted regression trees vs some other ML technique?
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Introduction Gradient Boosted Regression Trees}
\begin{itemize}
    \item (\checkmark-) Explain a classification and regression tree (CART).  (Move to theory or appendix?)
    \item (\checkmark-) Explain gradient boosting.  (Move to theory or appendix?)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Feature Engineering}
\begin{itemize}
    \item ($\cdot$) Select a predictive variable set that can describe the behavior of the conditional quantiles and copula everywhere in the assembly.
    \item ($\cdot$) Justify choice of predictive variables.
    \item ($\cdot$) Perform parameter culling via first-pass Gradient boosting. (Maybe move to future work). Critical for multi-pin cases where it is
        important to different between each pin in the core.  For instance: what makes an edge pin special?  Can we predict the impact of neighboring
        guide tubes on the crud growth rate?
    \item ($\cdot$) Perform principle component analysis on the remaining predictive variables. (Maybe move to future work.)

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Training the Quantile Regressors}

\begin{itemize}
    \item ($\cdot$) Show temperature and TKE Q-Q plots elucidating bias introduced by the machine learning model at a variety of axial positions and local core conditions.
    \item (\xmark) \sout{Compute quantile uncertainty estimates asscociated with predicted quantiles provided by the trained ML model} (Unsure if feasible)
    \item (\xmark) \sout{Propagate ML model-induced quantile uncertainties} (Future work)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Training the Copula Classifier}

\begin{itemize}
    \item ($\cdot$)  Show ML predicted copula vs CFD truth.  Compute the classification error rate.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Multi State Point 5x5 Results}

\begin{itemize}
    \item ($\cdot$) Step a 5x5 assebly forward in time using hi2lo model with the trained ML model supplying quantiles and copula.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item ($\cdot$) Test ramp up and ramp down in power.
        \item ($\cdot$) Test change in power shapes.
        \item ($\cdot$) Test change in flow rate.
    \end{itemize}

\end{itemize}
