The 

\section{Generating Synthetic Data}

\begin{itemize}
    \item (\checkmark) Describe the synthetic data generation tool developed to test the hi2lo procedure.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item CTF results are augmented by user controlled noise distributed according to
                $\tilde \varepsilon(z, \tilde \theta)$
                and potentially shifted by a user set bias,
                $\tilde b(z)$ where $z$ is the axial position along the rod.
                $\tilde \theta$ represents user specified distribution parameters.
                \begin{equation}
                    T(z) = \mu_{ctf}(z) + \tilde \varepsilon (z, \tilde \theta) + \tilde b(z)
                \end{equation}
        \end{itemize}
    \item (\checkmark) Show original CTF solution with added synthetic noise.
    \item \textbf{Note}: The synthetic CFD data generation tool does not capture spatial auto-correlation of the surface fields.  It does not reflect
        the physics of fluid flow.
\end{itemize}

\section{Single CTF Face Comparisons}
\begin{itemize}
    \item (\checkmark) Compare CTF vs Synthetic CFD vs Hi2Lo Reconstructed CRUD results on a single CTF face.
    \item (\checkmark) Show sensitivity of integrated crud mass and boron to the following tunable parameters.  Also show impact on uncertainty in these integrated results to:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item (\checkmark) The number of samples drawn per patch
            \item (\checkmark) Gaussian copula vs. best fit copula approach.
            \item (\checkmark) Number of quantiles used in the reconstruction of margins
        \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{Single Pin Comparisons}

\begin{itemize}
    \item (\checkmark) Compare CTF vs Synthetic CFD vs Hi2Lo Reconstructed CRUD results for a full pin for fixed TH conditions.
    \item (\checkmark) Show sensitivity of integrated crud mass and boron to the following.  Also show impact on uncertainty in these integrated results to:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item (\checkmark) Increase the number of samples drawn per patch
            \item (\checkmark) Force Gaussian copula vs. best fit copula approach.
        \end{itemize}
    \item (\checkmark) Show difference between Hi2Lo vs CTF predicted fractional surface area above a threshold ($T_{sat}$).  Clearly, the CTF result
        is unable to capture small scale effects of the mixing vanes on the surface temperature distribution.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Single Pin with Time Stepping}

\subsubsection{Spatial Remapping Results}
\begin{itemize}
    \item (\checkmark) Show influence of hot spot stationarity assumptions on crud growth.
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
    \item (\checkmark) Show total integrated crud mass and crud boron as a function of time.
    \item (\checkmark) Show sensitivity of integrated crud mass and boron to the following.  Also show impact on uncertainty in these integrated results to:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item (\checkmark) Increase the number of samples drawn per patch.
            \item (\checkmark) Force Gaussian copula vs. best fit copula approach.
            \item (\checkmark) Increasing number of re-sampling time steps.
                We can re-sample from the joint $h(T, k, q'')$ distribution many times per TH state point.
                This reduces variance in the total integrated boron and crud mass quantities.
        \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

Section Takeaways:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Increasing the number of samples per patch decreases variance in total crud and total preciptated boron esitmates.
    \item Increasing the number of re-sampling steps reduces uncertainty.
\end{itemize}
