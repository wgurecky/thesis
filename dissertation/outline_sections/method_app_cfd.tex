\section{Single Pin Comparisons}

\begin{itemize}
    \item (\checkmark-) Show Kendall's tau vs Axial position for a single pin.  The rank correlation coefficient shows
    the influence of spacer grids on the joint distribution of temperature and turbulent kinetic energy.
    \item ($\cdot$) Show predicted Copula as a function of axial position.  Is there a clear trend here (i.e. is a guassian copula
        a good fit far away from spacer grids and the clayton copula a better fit near spacer grids?  (TODO: create this plot functionality - capability to compute best-fit copula already exists)
    \item (\checkmark-) Compare Gaussian vs best-fit copula crud results.
    \item (\checkmark-) Show axial crud comparisons for a single hi2lo, CFD and CTF pin.
    \item (\checkmark-) Show integrated crud comparisons for a single hi2lo, CFD and CTF pin.
\end{itemize}

\section{Multi Pin Comparisons}

\begin{itemize}
    \item (\checkmark-) Exercise hi2lo method with 5x5 CFD data set.
    \item (\checkmark-) Show pin-by-pin statistics to show if a geometric bias is present.  Are we always over predicting crud
    in pins near the edge of the assembly?
    \item (\checkmark-) Show axial CFD vs CTF vs hi2lo results for each pin.
    \item (\checkmark-) Compare total integrated assembly crud mass and boron bass for CFD vs CTF vs hi2lo.
\end{itemize}
