For deployment as an in-line statistically based downscaling tool which sits between a subchannel code and a crud simulation code in a core simulator such as VERA the model is required to perform the hi2lo mapping for all pins in the core at any operating condition.  In other words, the model must be evaluable at any local core conditions typical of an operating PWR.  Since the training data set cannot contain all possible pin geometries, loading configurations and operating conditions due to computational expense, the model must make a prediction for the copula and marginal distribution parameters between known states. 

One might envision a table-lookup approach where high fidelity CFD flow field maps are pre-computed and stored for a wide array of flow and power conditions.  A nearest neighbor interpolation scheme could then be applied to extract the best-matching CFD map provided some local core state.  This however, is not tractable since the number of CFD computations to build the data base would be prohibitively large.  

% It is appealing to transform the problem of hi2lo construction from performing spatial flow map prediction into one of summary statistics prediction where much less information is required adequately fill out the operating envelope.  

In this chapter the hi2lo methodology introduced in this work is exercised against a small CFD data set derived from a 5x5 fuel assembly operating at realistic PWR conditions.  A leave-one-out cross validation strategy is used to asses the predictive performance of the model.


\section{CFD Data Source}

For the generation of high fidelity CFD data sets the Westinghouse 5x5 test stand shown in figures \ref{fig:5x5topdown} and \ref{fig:5x5side} was used to prepare the CAD geometry.  The CFD mesh consisted of approximately 25 million cells and 1e5 surface elements per pin.  A matching CTF input deck for the 5x5 assembly was also constructed with 100 axial zones.  The CTF and CFD codes were then executed for a variety of flow conditions and power levels.

\subsection{Preprocessing}
\label{sec:preprocessing}

Pre-processing requires paired CFD and CTF results for a given pin generated with consistent boundary conditions between the codes.
First each of the CFD $\{T,k,q''\}$ fields are aggregated onto the CTF face centers.  In the aggregation procedure spatial information is discarded within each CTF patch.  The aggregated CFD data are associated with a unique CTF face and corresponding local core conditions which comprise the predictive variable set given in table \ref{tab:features}.  The aggregated CFD field distributions are subtracted from the mean CTF predictions in each CTF face and the resultant (CFD-CTF) residual distributions are sored in an HDF5 table along with predictive variables.  

Copula fitting by the maximum likelihood method with AIC model selection is carried out on each CTF face.  Additionally, the empirical Kendall's $\tau$ rank correlation coefficient is computed from the raw CFD data on each CTF face. Figure \ref{fig:copula_predicted} shows the copula parameters estimated from the raw CFD data on each pin as a function of axial position for the first 4 pins in the 5x5 CFD model.  There is a marked change in behavior of the copula between the pins.  This was an unexpected find since the flow patterns were speculated to be reasonably consistent from pin to pin.  Also, the influence of spacer grids on the correlation coefficient between the temperature and TKE fields is visible.  Across spacer grids the correlation coefficient first sharply falls indicating a tighter coupling between the TKE and temperature surface fields as the flow necks down when entering a grid.  This is followed by a sharp change in Kendall's $\tau$ towards unity indicating the temperature and TKE surface fields become less correlated immediately following the mixing vanes.  This change in correlation behavior is posited to be due to turbulent mixing effects.  The computed copula parameters are also stored alongside the raw temperature, TKE, and boundary heat flux aggregated residual distribution data in the HDF5 table.

\end{figure}

After pre-processing, the HDF5 table includes a list of predictive scalar values, $\mathbf p$, which are shown in table \ref{tab:features}, and a list of associated response variables; the copula parameters and residual sample distribution for $\{T,k,q''\}$ on each CTF face. 

\subsection{Feature Engineering}

The objective of feature engineering is to select a predictive variable set that can describe the behavior of the conditional quantiles and copula everywhere in the assembly.   
   
\begin{table}[h]
    \begin{center}
    \caption[Included exogenous training features.]{Features included in the gradient boosted models as exogenous variables.}
\begin{tabular}[h]{|l | l | l | l |}
    \hline
    Sym & Label & Feature & Unit \\
    \hline
    \hline
    $T$ & ctf\_twall\_avg & CTF Face surface temperature & $[K]$ \\
    $R_T$ & ctf\_twall\_range & Surface temperature range in 4 adjacent faces & $[K]$ \\ 
    $q''$ & ctf\_bhf\_avg & Local CTF face heat flux & $[W/m^2]$ \\
    $R_{q''}$ & ctf\_bhf\_range & Heat flux range in 4 adjacent faces & $[W/m^2]$ \\ 
    $u_z$ & w\_bulk & CTF subchannel bulk Z Velocity &  $[m/s]$ \\
    $k$ & ctf\_tke\_avg & Local CTF face near wall TKE &  $[J/kg]$ \\
    $R_k$ & ctf\_tke\_range & CTF TKE range in 4 adjacent faces & $[J/kg]$ \\ 
    $z$ & z & Global axial position & $[m]$ \\
    $\delta z_g$ & dz\_grid & Position relative to nearest spacer grid & $[m]$ \\
    $N_g$ & n\_upsteam\_grid  & Nearest upstream spacer grid ID & $[]$ \\
    $T_\infty$ & t\_bulk & Subchannel bulk temperature  &  $[K]$ \\
    \hline
\end{tabular}
\label{tab:features}
\end{center}
\end{table}

The predictive variables given in table \ref{tab:features} were selected based on two criteria:  availability and orthogonality.  A predictive variable must be made available by VERA or must be computable from CTF results alone.  This must be true since when evaluating the hi2lo model, the inputs to the hi2lo model must come from either previously stored information or information made available by CTF at runtime.  At this juncture, this criteria precludes using information such as geometric orientation of a given spacer grid since it is not possible to extract or infer this information from the CTF output.

It is not useful to include multiple variables which are co-linear. The bulk fluid density was not included in the predictive variable set as it strongly depends on the local temperature. Likewise the local static pressure was not used as a predictive variable since this would be one-to-one with the axial position.  The exclusion of this TH information is primarily done for computational saving when training the boosted models since, as opposed to other machine learning algorithms and statistical inference techniques, gradient boosting is robust to collinearity of features in the input space. 

In this case the inclusion of nuisance or collinear exogenous variables in the model will not necessarily reduce the model's ability to generalize to unseen data, only hamper computational efficiency.  The resulting feature importance plot shown in figure \ref{fig:ktauregfeatureimp} suggests that the relative axial position within a span does not provide predictive power since this information is redundant provided the absolute axial position and the nearest upstream spacer grid.  

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.6\linewidth]{figs/ktau_reg_feature_imp}
    \caption[Relative feature importance.]{Relative feature importances on kendall's $\tau$.}
    \label{fig:ktauregfeatureimp}
\end{figure}

TODO: Include example training table.  With predictive features and endogenous variable columns.



\subsection{Cross Validation}

An estimate of the interpolation error incurred when evaluating the trained models at unknown CFD states can be made by performing a leave one out (LOO) cross validation study.

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.3\linewidth]{figs/drawings/5x5_loo}
    \caption[Example pin layout for leave-one-out cross validation procedure.]{Example pin layout for leave-one-out cross validation procedure.  The gradient boosted models are trained on CFD and CTF data extracted from the blue pins.  Crud predictions are made on the missing pin.}
    \label{fig:5x5loo}
\end{figure}


As depicted in figure \ref{fig:5x5loo}, in this procedure a single CFD/CTF pin pair is removed from the database and then the model is retrained on remaining data.  Following this retraining, a crud prediction is made 
at the missing pin's TH conditions.  The crud results are compared against crud results generated using the full training data set.  This process is repeated by sequentially for each pin in the 5x5 set.  The differences are summarized and averaged to obtain a measure of model's predictive performance when applied to TH conditions that reside in the TH training envelope.

This cross validation technique only ascertains interpolation errors within the TH envelope enclosed by the original full training set.  The resulting interpolation error estimates cannot be extrapolated to core conditions that lay outside of the training set.  For a robust interpolation error analysis, a much larger training data set is required
that spans essentially all possible TH conditions encountered in an operational PWR.  This will require large scale CFD runs and is left as a avenue for future uncertainty quantification work.

\subsection{Quantile Regressors}

A principal goal of the machine learning model is to predict the shape of the conditional teperature and TKE distributions as a function of local core conditions.  

Quantile-quantile (Q-Q) plots of the  temperature and TKE residual distributions are used to elucidate bias introduced by the machine learning model in the conditional quantiles at a variety of axial positions and local core conditions.  Estimated quantiles are obtained for the left-out pin by evaluating the trained reduced LOO model and are compared to the expected CFD result.
A subset of the TKE residual quantile regression results are given in figure \ref{fig:tkepin1} to \ref{fig:tkepin3}.  A complete set of quantile regression results are provide in chapter \ref{chap:app_ml}, Appendix A. The Q-Q plots summarize the biases in the conditional quantile distributions when compared to the target golden standard CFD data.  The maximum and average Kolmogorov–Smirnov (KS) statistic is provided in the Q-Q figures for each pin which can be computed by equation \ref{eq:ks_stat}.
\begin{equation}
KS = \mathrm{sup}(\{\hat F(\tau_i) - F(\tau_i)\})
\label{eq:ks_stat}
\end{equation}
Where $\mathrm{sup}(\cdot)$ is the supremum of the set of distances between the predicted and empirical cumulative densities $\{\hat F(\tau_i) - F(\tau_i)\}$.
This statistic was computed at each axial level on the CTF grid.

A subset of the Temperature residual quantile regression results are given in figure \ref{fig:temppin1} to \ref{fig:temppin3}.  Similar to the TKE conditional quantiles, the conditional temperature distribution exhibits sharp changes in behavior across the spacer grids.  Discontinuities enforced the choice of a machine learning algorithm which is resilient to extremely sharp gradients in the response surface.

The ability of the gradient boosting method to predict conditional quantiles is  

\subsection{Kendall's $\tau$ Regression}

The rank correlation coefficient, Kendall's $\tau$ ($\rho_\tau$), is used to quantify the strength of dependence between the temperature and TKE on the rod surface in each CTF face.  A separate gradient boosted regression model was tasked with predicting this statistic as a function of local core conditions.   The growth rate of crud was shown to be sensitive to   $\rho_\tau$ in section \ref{sec:crud_copula_sensi}, figure \ref{fig:patchcrudfit80}.  It is therefore important to understand the error and uncertainty carried by the predicted $\hat \rho_\tau$ values in each CTF face.  

A subset of the 5x5 assembly's Kendall's $\tau$ regression results are given in figure \ref{fig:ktauregression} and the complete 5x5 $\rho_\tau$ LOO cross validation results are given in figure \ref{fig:ktauregressionmontage}.  There is a marked change in behavior of the rank correlation coefficient as a function of axial position in the core from pin to pin.  The influence of Kendall's $\tau$ on the CTF face-integrated crud results was discussed in section \ref{sec:crud_copula_sensi}, and it was shown to be an important parameter to accurately predict via the machine learning model.  Pins with large relative errors for Kendall's $\tau$ are expected to produce anomalously poor crud predictions.

The worst performing pin with respect to $\hat \rho_\tau$ prediction was pin 8, as indicated in table () and figure \ref{fig:ktauregressionmontage}.  Interestingly, this pin exhibited relatively good agreement between the predicted crud distribution and the expected CFD crud distribution as indicated in table \ref{tab:loo_crud_bmass} and figure \ref{fig:montageaxialbmasssm}.  This pin, however, was relatively cold in comparison to the others in the fuel bundle, growing only $5.9$e-2 $[g]$ of crud in 300 days when the hotest rods grew $1.4$e0 $[g]$ in the same time.  In the case of pin 8, since the majority of the rod surface exists below the saturation point the crud is not sensitive to the shape of the joint temperature and TKE distributions.  

\begin{figure}[H]%
    \centering
    \subfloat[Pin 1]{{\includegraphics[width=0.45\linewidth]{figs/ml_fit/ktau_regression_1} }}%
    \qquad
    \subfloat[Pin 2]{{\includegraphics[width=0.45\linewidth]{figs/ml_fit/ktau_regression_2} }}%
    \qquad
    \subfloat[Pin 3]{{\includegraphics[width=0.45\linewidth]{figs/ml_fit/ktau_regression_3} }}%

    \qquad
    \caption[Kendall's $\tau$ regression LOO results.]{Kendall's $\tau$ regression results from LOO cross validation study.}%
    \label{fig:ktauregression}%
\end{figure}
To improve the performance of the Kendall's $\tau$ regressors, a larger training set could be generated in future work.  For this limited 25 pin data set, it is hypothesized that each pin has a substantially unique flow field when compared to the other 24 pins.  Expelling a pin from the training data set for cross validation causes the predictive performance of the model to suffer since the remaining pins in the training set do not provide the requisite information about the local core conditions vs. Kendall's $\tau$ relationship for the missing pin.

\subsection{Copula Classifier}

In addition to the rank correlation coefficient, Kendall's $\tau$, the copula family is also required to recover the copula density function on each CTF face.  To this end a gradient boosted classifier was trained on the available CFD data.  Copula information extracted from the raw CFD results is shown in figure \ref{fig:copula_predicted}.

Figure \ref{fig:confusionmatrixavg} summarizes the LOO cross validation results of the copula classifier as a confusion matrix.  The diagonal entries of the confusion matrix represent the correctly labeled copula predictions made by the reduced LOO trained classifier for each copula family average over the entire 5x5 assembly.  It is shown that on average the classifier predicts an incorrect result more often than not.  

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{figs/confusion_matrix_avg}
    \caption[Copula classifier confusion matrix.]{Copula classifier confusion matrix.}
    \label{fig:confusionmatrixavg}
\end{figure}


The copula classifiers performance averaged over all pins is shown in figure \ref{fig:confusionmatrixavg}. The copula classifier struggles to predict the correct copula class given the local TH state and axial core position.  As indicated in figure \ref{fig:copula_predicted}, the behavior of the copula as a function of axial rod position are erratic and inconsistent from pin to pin.  Introducing other TH exogenous variables in addition to the axial position did not increase the classification score significantly.  We can conclude that the copula are not well described by local core condition and axial position.  It remains as future work to investigate if including additional geometric pin and grid attributes could improve the classification results.  Additional software infrastructure would be required to both write geometric pin and grid features from CTF and to utilize the geometric features in the current model.

Additional future work could include performing a transformation of the input space so that the copula labels are more easily separable in the transformed space.  A Potential candidate for building this transformation is the UMAP [ref] manifold learning algorithm.  

A complementary strategy to transforming the original data set as a preprocessing step is a ensemble machine learning technique known as stacking [ref].  Stacking combines the predictions of multiple classifiers using a meta-classifier.  Since model tuning and ML performance is not a focus of this work, the application of this technique to improve copula classification results is left as future work.  

Though improvements are possible, it should also be noted that section \ref{sec:crud_copula_sensi} and table \ref{tab:crud_totals_copula} show that the copula family does not significantly influence overall pin integrated crud results.  Gains in the copula classifier accuracy will not translate to a large improvement in crud prediction accuracy.

The correlation between errors committed by the multiple quantile and $\rho_\tau$ regressors on the errors seen in the crud results was investigated in an attempt to establish performance metrics.  If a statistically significant trend can be drawn between the ML model performance and predicted crud accuracy results then the trend could be used as an indicative tool for testing the a.  To do this, one could first compute the ML regression errors via a cross validation strategy.  Provided these error estimates and known sensitivities of the crud results to the ML errors one can estimate the expected accuracy of the crud predictions obtained via the hi2lo model.  This allows a user of the hi2lo tool to detect problems with the ML models before using the model to make crud predictions.

As shown in the upper-triangle of figure \ref{fig:asmerrorcorr} a Student-T test was conducted on the slope of each fitted linear trend model.  The null hypothesis was taken to be a slope of 0.  One can conclude that a  sample size greater than 25 pins should be used in future work to investigate the relative influence of machine learning errors on the predicted crud errors.  The standard deviation of the computed sensitivities is high when using a small sample size making it difficult to rigorously conclude that errors made by the machine learning models correspond to errors in the crud predictions.  

Statistically significant trends were found between the RMS error committed by the TKE quantile regressors and the crud boron and mass distribution errors, as measured by root-mean-squared error.

\section{Section Takeaways}


\begin{itemize}
    \item Crud predictions made by the hi2lo model were compared against CFD/crud coupled results and stanalone CTF/crud results.  The Hi2lo model produced crud results closer to the CFD result than the CTF result, as anticipated.  The overall crud mass results for the 5x5 assembly favorably compared against the gold-standard CFD assembly integrated results. 
    \item A leave one out cross validation strategy was utilized to quantify the predictive performance of the model.  
    \item The prediction accuracy of the temperature and TKE quantile regression models was summarized though Q-Q plots for each pin in the LOO cross validation study.
    \item The prediction accuracy of the Kendall's $\tau$ regression model was assessed using the root-mean-square error for each pin in the LOO cross validation study.  \item Correlations between the errors committed by the machine learning models and the crud prediction errors were computed.  High uncertainty associated with these correlation measures did not permit a statistically significant link between poor Kendall's $\tau$ predictive performance and poor crud predictions to be drawn.
	\item The copula classifier performed poorly given the current set of considered explanatory variables and limited size of the training data set.  A Gaussian copula was assumed on each CTF face in place of the poorly predicted copula family from the classifier.  Recalling the results shown in \ref{sec:crud_copula_sensi}, this is not expected to reduce crud prediction accuracy.
\end{itemize}
