\section{5x5 Leave-One-Out Machine Learning Results}


Gradient boosted quantile regression model results are presented in figures \ref{fig:qtwallregressionmontagesm} and \ref{fig:qtkeregressionmontagesm}.  For each pin, the predictions are made for the left-out-pin and compared to the original CFD training data.  The gradient boosted results are shown as solid lines and the original CFD-CTF data is shown as broken lines. 

The presented quantile regression results are shown as a function of axial position along the rod for the residual surface temperature and TKE distributions, e.g $\hat q_{\tau}(z) = \mathbf b(z) + \varepsilon(z)$, where $\mathbf b(z) = \mu_{\mathrm{cfd}} - \mu_{\mathrm{ctf}}$.   The results were averaged over the 4 azimuthal CTF faces at each axial level in the CTF grid.   The root-mean-square (RMS) error of select quantiles prediction vs axial location are given in each figure.

Figures \ref{fig:qqtwallmontagesm} to \ref{fig:qqtkepinmontage} show quantile-quantile (Q-Q plots) for each pin in the 5x5 LOO results.  Each Q-Q plot summarizes the overall prediction quality afforded by the quantile regression averaged over the entire pin length.  At each CTF axial grid level, the Kolmogorovâ€“Smirnov (KS) statistic was computed to quantify the goodness-of-fit of the quantile distribution reconstruction to the original, empirical CFD-CTF distribution. The average and maximum KS statistic encountered is recorded in each figure.

Additionally, the predicted rank correlation coefficient as a function of axial position made by the LOO-trained models are compared to the expected result in \ref{fig:ktauregressionmontage}.  The RMS error between the predicted $\hat \rho_\tau(z)$ and the CFD computed $\rho_\tau(z)$ is shown in each figure.
