I would like to acknowledge Dr. Kevin Clarno, Dr. Stuart Slattery, Dr. Derek Haas, Dr. Sheldon Landsberger, and Dr. Ben Leibowicz for their technical guidance and general advice throughout my graduate studies.

Special thanks to Dr. Erich Schneider who fostered many a student's interest in nuclear engineering \& software development, including mine.

Funding for this project was supplied by the Consortium for Advanced Simulation of Light Water Reactors, a United States Department of Energy innovation hub.
