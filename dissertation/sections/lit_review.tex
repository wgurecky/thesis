    An empirical relationship between the Nusselt number ratio and the vane angle, $\phi$, blockage ratio $\epsilon$, dimensionless distance from the grid, $x/D$, and fraction of flow area impeded by the vanes, $A$, was developed by S. C. Yao et. al (1982) [ref].
\begin{equation}
\frac{Nu}{Nu_0}  = \left[ 1 + 5.55 \epsilon^2 e^{-0.13(x/D)}\right] + \left[ 1 + A^2\mathrm{tan}^2\phi e^{-0.034(x/D)} \right]
\end{equation}
Where the first term is accounts for the effect of grid flow restriction and the second term represents the contribution of vane induced swirl on the heat transfer.

    Similar to Yao apporach.  Additionally developed a TKE remap.
    
    Convective HTC remap:
    \begin{equation}
    	\mathbf m_h = \frac{(Nu)_{cfd}}{(Nu)_{ctf}} = \frac{h_{cfd} L_{cfd} k_{ctf} }{h_{ctf}k_{cfd} L_{ctf}} 
    \end{equation}
    Where $Nu$ is the nusselt number.  Assuming equal length scales and thermal conductivities:
    \begin{equation}
    	\mathbf m_h = \frac{h_{cfd}}{h_{ctf}} = \frac{q_{cfd}(T-T_\infty)_{ctf}}{q_{ctf}(T-T_\infty)_{cfd}}
    \end{equation}
    Apply HTC remap:
    \begin{equation}
    	\hat h_{l} = \mathbf m_h h_{ctf}
    \end{equation}
    $\hat h_l$ is the hi2lo remapped convective heat transfer coefficient.  In CTF the wall heat transfer is split between phases:
    \begin{equation}
    	q'' = q''_{conv} + q''_{boil} = (h_l)(T-T_{\infty}) + q''_{boil}(T)
    \end{equation}
    In order to compute augmented hi2lo surface temperatures
    several iterations are required to converge upon the correct surface temperature, $\hat T_s$ due to the surface boiling term.
    
    \begin{algorithm}[H]
    Guess $T^{i=0}_s=T_0$.  Maximum number, $N$ iterations.
    
	\For{i in range($N$):}{
	Evaluate effective multiphase CTF HTC: $h_{eff} = h_{{ctf}}(T^i_{s}, \hat h_l, q'')$ \;
	Compute new hi2lo surface temperatures: $T_{s} = \frac{q''}{h_{eff}} + T_\infty$ \;
	Under relax  $T^{i+1}_{s} = \omega T_{s} + (1 - \omega) T^{i}_{s} ;\ \omega < 1.$ \;
	\textbf{break if}:  $|T^{i+1}_s - T^i_s| < tol$ \;
	}
	\textbf{return}: $\hat T_s = T^{i+1}_s$
	\end{algorithm}
    Where $h_{ctf}(\cdot)$ is a callable CTF function that returns and effective multiphase HTC, $h_{eff}$.
    
    TKE remap:
    \begin{equation}
       \mathbf m_{k} = \frac{k_{cfd}}{k_{ctf}}
    \end{equation}
    Apply TKE remap:
       \begin{equation}
       \hat k = \mathbf m_k k_{ctf}
       \end{equation}
     Grow crud using augmented temperature and tke surface fields and compute average crud results over the CTF face:
     \begin{equation}
     \mu_g = \frac{1}{A} \sum_i^N g(\hat T_{s_i}, \hat k_i, q''_i) a_i
     \end{equation}
    Where $A$ is the area of the CTF face and $a_i$ is the area of each cell face on the CRUD coupling mesh.
