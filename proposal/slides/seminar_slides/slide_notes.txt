1) GJ
2) k. not k. add adj. to theory.  Data prep detail. (preproc)
3) Too many words.  Kll the words.  Leave crud images.  Remove crud "toy equation". 
	describe what crud is concisely.
	add source to images. 
	Remove propositions (of .., on ...) 
	MAMABA in VERA core sim.
	CIPS.???  Metion challenge problems!!!!
	Follow: (Open, challenge, action, resolution)
4) Move slide ???  Arrow by power increase (denote what is changing) keep it DRY. move captions to bullets at top.
5) Align figs vert.  (full foot cite).  Make refernces grey or lighter
6) Consider better title.  
	- Burnup distriubtion shift. eg: fuel utilization & shutdown margin.
	- Impacts DNB calculations
	- CILC  (put in footnote)
	- Goal: Predict crud.
7) too much text.  Chop to frag. noo..
8) Shorten bullets.  Remove second bullet.
9) Put ref in footnote.  Simplify.  (full foot cite).
10) CRUD -> crud .  bold prior -> bold post.  Place on.  Add reference.
11) Remove repleated CFD/Crud... DRY
12) Meshing CFD vs CTF.  Label CTF and CFD images.
13) Investigate weird shadowbox. (z, theta) -> correct to proper notation.  Careful with bolding variables (means vector.)
	- draw attention to formula.  Lighten the parameter defs (or smaller.)
	- remove 'is' replace with :
14) Objectives are too complicated. 
15) Define sym on the bottom of slide move fig up.
16) This is good.  NVM.  Remove prep phrase.  Make CFD and CTF different color. Script G  
17) To predict h on each CTF face.  Remove  "Compute the total".  
	Remove expected total crud bullet.  Put A and del t in parens.
	replace defs with :
	"integral via Monte Carlo.
18) do duummy var in CDF def. w.  Subscripts for CDFs.  Remove "has"  and "describes".
	decompose h(.) as:
	Move the marginal density parameters up to defs.
19) Kill.
20) Put "assumptions" on the top.  Remove Assume from bullets.  Remove repeated theta defs at end.
21) Fix second bullet.  Add image of mappting thetas to CTF faces.
22)
23) Add introduction to gradient boosting.

30) replace (a) and (b) with labels.
