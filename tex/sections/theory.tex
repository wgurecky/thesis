\section{Hi2Low Approach}

In this approach the the deterministic and random components of the spatial field are modeled seperately.  The deterministic component is supplied by the coarse CTF solution and an model that describes small purtubations from the mean is constructed upon available CFD data sets.

The availability of the deterministic portion of the fields of interest via CTF is a boon the proposed Hi2Low methodology.  Typically, additional modeling descisions must be made to construct an estimator for the average behavior of the output fields.
